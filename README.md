# CaesarCipherDecoderAndEncoder
A decoder/encoder for the Caesar Cipher.
This program can encode and decode messages, using the Caesar Cipher. 

**1. Encode**
The encoding works by changing the characters with the corresponding ones in the ASCII table, following a given shift. 

**2. Decode**
The decoding is just the encoding method, but executed for all 26 possible shifhts. It also has implemented AI for suggesting the most accurate shift for decoding the text.
This AI works by collecting data (correct words) in a .txt file and comparing all words in the decoded messages with the known accurate words.
